A Million Little Pieces by James Frey is his personal account of his time in rehab getting off a whole slew of substances. This is one of those books that I think everyone should read, and it gave me a much clearer picture of what addiction is truly like.

These days, I'm constantly terrified. Depression feels like a drug to me, and the way Frey described his addiction rang familiar. It's this perfect solution that lets me forego all responsibility; it immediately defeats any drive I have to do something that requires long-term, consistent effort, and I feel bad for indulging in it when I have clarity, but it's comfortingly familiar when I don't.

In the 3 years since my depression was at its peak, I've gotten a lot better simply by changing locations and interacting less with toxic people I used to have to see every day, but I feel like I'm constantly on the precipice of falling back into it. Like, I know studying is something that only really builds on itself. If I don't study, I lose time, but I don't lose information. I can always pick it up again tomorrow. But I don't feel like that. When I have a productive day, I feel like myself. The version of me that's slowly improving, that I've been working on for the past couple of years, that's a functional and normal human being. But when I slack off, even for an hour or so, I feel like I'm back exactly where I started, that I haven't changed at all, that all my efforts have gone to waste and I'll have to start all over again.  When I procrastinate, I feel like I lose my whole identity for the rest of the day.

So it doesn't feel like my progress builds. It feels like I can lose it all at any moment. Like my head is about to go underwater the moment I stop kicking and flailing.

But at least drugs can physically be taken away while you're recovering. How do you rid yourself of a feeling? Of an idea? It's just a habit at this point. I'll realize that I have some responsibility that I need to fulfill, and then think to myself, "What's the point? The only reason I care about this is because I’m making myself. If I just stopped caring, I wouldn't have to do it."

And then I stop caring. And it's so, so easy to stop caring; it takes me about as much effort as blinking. But it's so difficult to try to care again.

This comparison is extreme, I know. But. I don't know how else to convey the immensity of my fear and disappointment. It's all me. I don't trust myself. I don't trust my willpower. I freeze up with fear whenever I think about it.

I'm scared. I feel like I’ll lose everything with one little slip up these days.
